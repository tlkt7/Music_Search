# Music Search

Created a music streaming app similar to Apple Music, featuring API integration for searching and displaying tracks.


## Technologies Used

- Swift
- CocoaPods
- Alamofire 
- SwiftyJSON 
- SDWebImage 
- SVProgressHUD 


## What I Learned

While developing this project, I learned how to integrate external APIs and work with asynchronous network requests. I gained hands-on experience in handling JSON responses, managing app state during loading, and building smooth user interactions. I also worked with image downloading and caching to optimize performance, and learned how to structure an iOS project using third-party libraries and dependency management with CocoaPods.
